# Bugbear's Scripts

## Description
A small module for Foundry and Dnd5e which contains scripts that thislonelybugbear finds useful.

The ones included can at any point be altered, based on functionality absorbed/fixed/removed from relevant modules or the system.

The initial commit hooks on `preCreateActiveEffect` and `preUpdateActiveEffect`, in order to add the proper `MidiQOL flags` to the system's core status effects for:
- `blinded`,
- `dodging`,
- `encumbered`: Needs the system's setting for `Encumbrance Tracking` set to `Variant (encumbered & heavily encumbered)`,
- `exhaustion (1-5)`,
- `frightened`,
- `invisible`,
- `paralyzed`,
- `petrified`,
- `poisoned`,
- `prone`,
- `restrained`,
- `silenced`: Forces spells with V component to fail. You can create an Active Effect with `flags.midi-qol.fail.spell.vocal | Override | false | 20` which will cancel it out (think Subtle spell),
- `stunned`,
- `unconscious`.

## Compatibility notes.
- `DFreds Convenient Effects`: For compatibility make sure that you set the `Modify Status Effects` to `NONE`. As a side effect DFreds CE will be usable on dnd5e 3.x and Foundry 11/12.
- `Condition Lab Trigger`: For compatibility it is recommended to:
  - In `Condition Lab` settings menu, select the `Other/import mapping type` and move all you custom created conditions in there,
  - Uncheck the Remove Default Status Effects to get the default system's `statusEffects`.
- `Rest Recovery`: Provides exhaustion automation (when that setting is enabled it will take priority; NEEDS to reload Foundry if you change any relevant settings in RR).
- `Alternative Exhaustion 5e`: If that module is active, it will handle all the exhaustion effects and no MidiQOL flags will be added.
