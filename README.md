# Bugbear's Scripts (BUGS)
So BUGS is a module that provides some extra functionality when MidiQOL is active.
For now it will:
* add the proper MidiQOL flags to the system's status effect, like advantage when attacking a Blinded creature or disadvantage when attacking while being Blinded.
* add a way for automatically rolling and applying the corresponding effect when using the MidiQOL's Choose Effects functionality (more [here](<https://github.com/thatlonelybugbear/bugs/pull/32#issue-2993717699>))

<details>
  <summary><b>Supported Status effects</b></summary>
  
- `blinded`,
- `charmed` will try to automate:
  - _fail of activities that would do damage to the Charmer_: removed as it can be too invasive!
  - advantage for checks when the Charmer has the Charmed creature targeted before rolling!
- `dodging`,
- `encumbered`: when the system is set to legacy 5e rules and also `Encumbrance Tracking` set to `Variant (encumbered & heavily encumbered)`,
- `exhaustion (1-5)`: when the system is set to legacy 5e rules,
- `frightened`,
- `invisible`,
- `paralyzed`,
- `petrified`,
- `poisoned`,
- `prone`,
- `restrained`,
- `silenced`: Forces spells with V component to fail. You can create an Active Effect with `flags.midi-qol.fail.spell.vocal | Override | false | 20` which will cancel it out (think Subtle spell),
- `stunned`,
- `unconscious`.
</details>

### Compatibility notes
- `Rest Recovery`: Provides exhaustion automation (when that setting is enabled it will take priority; NEEDS to reload Foundry if you change any relevant settings in RR).
- `Alternative Exhaustion 5e`: If that module is active, it will handle all the exhaustion effects and no MidiQOL flags will be added.
- v12.438.1+ needs D&D5e 4.3.x
